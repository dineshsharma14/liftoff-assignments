## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I will write a travel agency webapp called history-trails that will allow users to build trails from the available set of heritage site places. The idea is to offer people a much seamless and guided experience of the place they are visiting, while taking care of things like multiple place accommodation, local transportation etc by travel agency.

The history-trails homepage should describe the site and invite users to register or login. Once logged in, a user should be able to create a trail (set of places he/she would like to visit) additionally user shall be choosing kind of accommodation, type of food preferred, type of vehicle they would prefer for local transportation (from the closest airport) and filling a form mentioning personal details.

Once the trail is made and user has filled the form they can place an order on travel agency.

### Features
Key features planned:

1. User Login - Users will be able to create accounts and log in to web application. Each user will be having a profile page as well.
2. Web page depicting various places in tiles with a picture, and a button to add in to trail.
3. As user will add places to make a trail they will be able to see My-Trails (with number of places selected)
4. A form to fill rest of details after making the trail with a button for placement of order on travel agency.

### Technologies
Java
SpringBoot MVC framework
MySQL 
Thymeleaf templating engine

### What I'll Have to Learn
